# Snake Game

## Description
This Snake Game project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around the game board, aiming to eat fruit and grow in length. The game ends if the snake collides with the game board's boundaries or with its own body.

The project is written in Java, utilizing JavaFX. It provides a basic user interface where the game can be played, and it includes features such as keeping track of the player's score and displaying it on the screen.

## Installation
To run the Snake Game project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Make sure you have [programming language] installed on your machine along with the required [library/framework].
3. Open the project in your favorite [programming language] IDE.
4. Compile and build the project.
5. Run the executable file or launch the game from the IDE.

## Gameplay Instructions
Once the Snake Game is launched, you can use the following controls to play the game:

* Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement direction.
* The snake will automatically start moving in the initially set direction.
* Guide the snake to eat the fruit represented by a distinct symbol.
* Each time the snake eats fruit and you will get **5 points**, it will grow longer and the player's score will increase.
* After eating 5th fruit a big fruit will be generated, which has **10 points**. You should eat it within 5 seconds otherwise it's size will be decreased and you will get only **5 points**.
* Avoid colliding with the game board boundaries or the snake's own body, as this will result in the game ending.
